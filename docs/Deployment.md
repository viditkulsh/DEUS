# DEUS Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the DEUS platform, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- Docker (latest version)
- Hardhat (for Ethereum development)
- Anchor (for Solana development)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

Clone the DEUS repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DEUS.git
cd DEUS
```

Build the Docker images for the development environment:

```bash
docker build -t deus-dev-env -f development/environment/Dockerfile .
```

### 2. Deploy Relay Contracts

#### Ethereum

Navigate to the Ethereum contracts directory and deploy:

```bash
cd core-protocol/contracts/Ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-ethereum-network>
```

#### Solana

Navigate to the Solana contracts directory and deploy:

```bash
cd core-protocol/contracts/Solana
anchor deploy
```

### 3. Set Up Validator Nodes

#### Ethereum Validator Node

Build and run the Geth node:

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/validator-nodes/ethereum/geth-node
docker build -t ethereum-validator -f Dockerfile .
docker run -d ethereum-validator
```

#### Parity Validator Node

Build and run the Parity node:

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/validator-nodes/parity/parity-node
docker build -t parity-validator -f Dockerfile .
docker run -d parity-validator
```

### 4. Configure P2P Network

Set up the P2P network using libp2p and Substrate:

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/p2p-network/libp2p
node node.js
```

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/p2p-network/substrate
cargo run --release
```

### 5. Start Message Queue and Monitoring

Run the message queue system:

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/message-queue
node queue.js
```

Run the monitoring system:

```bash
cd network-infrastructure/monitoring
node alerting-system.js
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify the contracts:

```bash
cd core-protocol
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network <your-ethereum-network>
```

### 7. Documentation and Maintenance

Refer to the `docs/Maintenance.md` for ongoing maintenance procedures and `docs/SecurityAudit.md` for security audit reports.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will set up the DEUS platform for cross-chain communication. Ensure to monitor the system and perform regular updates as necessary.
